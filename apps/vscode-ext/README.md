## Getting started

First, install the dependencies. Then run the debug server:

```bash
$ pnpm install

# then

$ pnpm watch

## VSCode Commands

First of all, you need to open Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`). Then few commands will be available to you. You just need to start typing `cc`, as you can see in the image below.
